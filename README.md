## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Flutter SDK:** [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
*   **Firebase CLI:** [Install Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install_the_firebase_cli)
*   **Supabase CLI:** [Install Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tickit.git
    cd tickit
    ```

2.  **Install Flutter dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**

    *   Create a new Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Install the Firebase CLI and log in:
        ```bash
        firebase login
        ```
    *   Associate your Flutter project with Firebase:
        ```bash
        flutterfire configure
        ```
        Follow the prompts to select your Firebase project and platforms.

4.  **Set up Supabase:**

    *   Create a new Supabase project in the [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/).
    *   Get your Supabase URL and Anon Key from your project settings (API section).
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Supabase and Firebase keys:

        ```
        SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
        SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
        FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
        ```
        Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL`, `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY` with your actual keys.

5.  **Generate Firebase options (if not already generated by `flutterfire configure`):**

    ```bash
    flutterfire configure
    ```
